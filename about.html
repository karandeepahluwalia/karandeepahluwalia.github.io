			<p>Hi, I'm Karandeep!</p>
			<p>		I'm a 21 year old software developer/data scientist who just graduated from Binghamton University with a degree in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I'm currently working with Binghamton University Professor Jeremy Blackburn to research the usage of memes as a metric for summarizing audience opinions during political events of the Canadian prime minister election. I am seeking work as Software Engineer/Data Scientist anywhere in the United States. Having always been passionate applying mathematics and critical thinking through programming to solve real world issues, I focused much of my college career on building optimal data structures and machine learning algorithms.
			</p>
			<p>	</t>	Highlighting some of my latest accomplishments, I worked for Live in Bing last summer, a real estate management company. Using Python, I created and optimized two neural networks responsible for estimating housing prices based on the house's features (location, number of bedrooms, etc). I also spent this last year as Programming Vice President of the Data Science and Analytics club in Binghamton where I created and demonstrated tutorials to show students various different aspects analyzing and visualizing data.
			</p>

			<p>		Prior to this year, I worked for Binghamton Center of Technology, designing lesson plans to entertain and educate high schoolers on using Unity (a game development platform) to spread interest in coding. Now that I have graduated, I'm looking forward to the exciting challenges I face with my future employment! If you think I would be a good fit for your company, please click the "contact" button on the top of the page and reach out to me! Below is some fun, non-career related interests of mine if you would like to keep reading!</p>
			<p>		I have been a part of the Ultimate Frisbee Community for 8 years now, competing at the high school, college, and club level. I have served as a captain on the Binghamton University team, and 2 summers ago, I even founded Pink Pear, a club team for Binghamton University alumni. Since graduating, I hope to train hard enough over this coming year to make it onto one of the top club teams in the region!</p>
			<p>So thanks for coming to my site and finding out all about me! If you have any questions, or would like to hear more about my professional experience, please feel free to contact me!
